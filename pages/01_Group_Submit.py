You enter your name and the name of your crush(es), both of which are hashed.
These hashes are stored according to your Group ID.

After everyone has entered their names and their crush's name, move onto the [results page]({os.environ['site_url']}/Group_Results).

Note that (anonymous), cryptographically secure hashes are saved to eliminate the need for link sharing. Please see [individual](os.environ['site_url']) for a link-based implementation that does not save any data.
Names are temporarily stored in your browser's local cookies.
